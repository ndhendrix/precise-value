- What is PRECISE-VALUE?
  - The prototype mathematical model – a decision tree – that estimates the value of Pharmacogenomic Testing (PGx) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Alerts. 
  - Provides a web-based, interactive R Shiny Application that generates customized estimates for Learning Health Systems (LHSs).

- PGx-CDS Alerts
  - PGx testing offers significant potential to guide prescribing, avoid adverse events, and improve health outcomes. 
  - CDS alerts that embeds PGx testing results provides opportunities that PGx testing results are delivered and utilized in clinical practice. 

- PRECISE Value Model Summary (hypothetical scenario based on real world data)
  - Who?
  
    - 500,000 enrollees
    - Age range 18-100 years
    - Three ethnic groups: White, Black, Asian
    - Reflect US General Population.
    
  - What interventions are compared?
  
    - Tested Intervention: PGx-CDS Alerts
    - Alternative (Comparator): Standard of Care, i.e., no PGx-CDS Alerts.
    
  - What diseases and drugs?
    - PGx testing on CYP2C19 shows opportunities to guide prescribing antiplatelets for patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)
    - PGx testing on CYP2C9, VKORC1, and CYP4F2 shows opportunity to inform warfarin dosages for patients with Atrial Fibrillation (AF)
